          Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with
          friends and family. Take a picture or video, choose a filter to
          transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that
          easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a
          new way to see the world. Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
